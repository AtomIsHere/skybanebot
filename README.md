# Skybane Bot
Skybane Bot is a spigot plugin written by me (Fusion) in order to handle essential functions on the Skybane server which is not handled by any other bot and to provide linking with the SMP and the Discord.

This plugin uses gradle to build and is Licensed under GNU GPL v3.0. If you need to contact please do so over on discord: Atom#1840.

**Pleaste Note:** This bot is intended to be used by the Skybane discord server, while it may be possible to set it up on other discords I will not provide support to do so. Although you can still contribute and create issues like normal.

## Dependencies
* DiscordSRV
* A modified version of the Hypixel Public API in your maven local which can be found here: https://github.com/AtomIsHere/PublicAPI
* A plugin for your preferred IDE to add support for the lombok project

## Building
Building this project is very simple. Make sure you have gradle installed, cd into the directory you clone this into and type `gradle jar`. You can also do this via your preferred IDE's GUI.
